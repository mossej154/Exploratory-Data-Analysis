#  Student Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the **Student Performance Dataset**, aiming to identify factors that influence academic success across three subjects: math, reading, and writing.

It demonstrates how exploratory data analysis (EDA) can uncover relationships between demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors using Python.

---

##  Project Goals

* Understand general trends in student performance
* Identify relationships between variables (e.g., gender, parental education, test preparation)
* Visualize key insights through clear and interpretable charts
* Present actionable conclusions and recommendations

---

##  Tools & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – documentation and analysis environment

---

##  Key Findings

* **Gender differences:** Female students tend to outperform in reading and writing, while males slightly lead in math.
* **Parental education:** Higher parental education levels correlate with better performance.
* **Lunch type:** Students with standard lunches tend to score higher, possibly linked to socioeconomic status.
* **Test preparation:** Completing a preparation course significantly improves results across all subjects.

---

##  Visuals

The analysis includes:

* Score distributions (histograms & KDE plots)
* Boxplots comparing scores by gender, lunch type, and test preparation
* Correlation heatmap between subjects

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete exploratory data analysis workflow — from data cleaning and visualization to interpretation and presentation.

It highlights my ability to:

* Work with real datasets
* Apply analytical thinking
* Communicate insights clearly
